            <h2>How to find planning applications</h2>
            <p>Planning applications for Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire are managed through the Greater Cambridge Shared Planning service. You can view and comment on planning applications online.</p>
            <p><a href="https://applications.greatercambridgeplanning.org/online-applications/">View and comment on planning applications</a></p>
            <p>To find a specific application, you can search by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application reference number</li>
                <li>Address or postcode</li>
                <li>Date range</li>
                <li>Application type</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to read planning applications</h2>
            <p>Planning applications typically include several key documents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Application form</strong> - Contains basic information about the proposal</li>
                <li><strong>Location plan</strong> - Shows where the site is in relation to the surrounding area</li>
                <li><strong>Site plan</strong> - Shows the layout of the proposed development</li>
                <li><strong>Elevations</strong> - Drawings showing the external appearance of the building</li>
                <li><strong>Design and access statement</strong> - Explains the design rationale and how access will be provided</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting documents</strong> - May include environmental assessments, heritage statements, or other technical reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Often, the design and access statement will be the most important document to read. It will explain the design rationale and a good summary of the proposed development. From there, if you want to dig into the details, you can look at the elevatons and site plan, or other specific documents.</p>
