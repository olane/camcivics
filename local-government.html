            <h1>Local Government in Cambridge</h1>
            <p>Understanding the different layers of local government can be confusing. This page explains the roles of the different councils that serve Cambridge.</p>

            <h2>The main layers</h2>
            
            <p>For most people in Cambridgeshire, there are two main layers of local government. These are the <strong>County Council</strong> and the <strong>District Council</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you live within the Cambridge city boundary, your district council is the Cambridge City Council. If you live outside the boundary your district council is South Cambridgeshire District Council (this includes some of the outer edges of what you might think of as Cambridge, such as Girton, Fen Ditton or the edge of Cherry Hinton). You can check the city boundary on the <a href="https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/city-and-ward-boundaries-map">city council website</a></p>
            
            <h3>District Councils</h3>
            <p><em>Examples: Cambridge City, East Cambridgeshire,
                Fenland, Huntingdonshire, South
                Cambridgeshire</em></p>
            <p>This is often the most local layer of government, unless you have a town or parish council. The district council is responsible for services like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Council tax collection</li>
                    <li>Bin collections and recycling</li>
                    <li>Council housing</li>
                    <li>Planning applications</li>
                    <li>Leisure centres and parks</li>
                    <li>Taxi licensing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Cambridgeshire County Council</h3>
            <p>The County Council covers the whole of Cambridgeshire and provides services that are best delivered over a larger area. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Schools and education</li>
                    <li>Roads and transport</li>
                    <li>Social care</li>
                    <li>Libraries</li>
                    <li>Trading standards</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>As the highways authority for the whole of Cambridgeshire, it is responsible for all roads in the county, including within Cambridge City.</p>

            <h2>Other layers</h2>

            <h3>Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA)</h3>
            <p>This is a newer layer of government, led by a directly elected Mayor (currently the Conservative Paul Bristow). It covers the whole of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and has responsibility for large-scale strategic projects, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Major transport projects</li>
                    <li>Adult education and skills</li>
                    <li>Affordable housing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>It receives most of the region&apos;s transport funding (apart fromthat held by the GCP) and lobbies for more investment. It will soon oversee most of the local bus network, following the recent decision to bring the region's buses under public control.</p>

            <h3>Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP)</h3>
            <p>In 2014, Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire signed a "city deal" which granted up to £500m in funding between 2015 and 2030 (subject to gateway reviews every 4-5 years). The <a href="https://www.greatercambridge.org.uk/">Greater Cambridge Partnership</a> was set up to use this funding to support growth in Cambridge and the surrounding area through infrastructure, housing and skills investment. Example projects which have benefited from this funding:
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgrades to "corridor" roads such as Milton Road and Histon Road</li>
                    <li>The greenways network of new/improved cycle routes from villages surrounding Cambridge</li>
                    <li>The proposed new station at Waterbeach</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Town/Parish Councils</h3>
            <p>Some areas, particularly on the edges of Cambridge and in surrounding villages, also have a Town or Parish Council. These are the most local level of government and generally have more limited powers but can be responsible for things like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Allotments</li>
                    <li>Community centres, village halls, recreation grounds</li>
                    <li>War memorials, bus shelters, benches</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Parish councils may also respond to planning applications and draw up neighbourhood plans to influence the decisions made by other authorities on things like housing and transport.</p>

            <h3>Cambridge Growth Company (CGP)</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://thecgc.org.uk/index.php">Cambridge Growth Company</a> was established by the government in 2024 and its stated aim is to "unlock and accelerate development and deliver the homes, jobs and infrastructure needed for long-term, sustainable growth." It was recently announced that government would be supplying funding of £400m to support this objective, although there are not yet hard details on how this will all be put together and work. It may be that it will operate quite similarly to the GCP in practice.
