            <p>Understanding the different layers of local government can be confusing. This page explains the roles of the different councils that serve Cambridge.</p>

            <h2>The main layers</h2>
            
            <p>For most people in Cambridgeshire, there are two main layers of local government. These are the <strong>County Council</strong> and the <strong>District Council</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you live within the Cambridge city boundary, your district council is the Cambridge City Council. If you live outside the boundary your district council is South Cambridgeshire District Council (this includes some of the outer edges of what you might think of as Cambridge, such as Girton, Fen Ditton or the edge of Cherry Hinton). You can check the city boundary on the <a href="https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/city-and-ward-boundaries-map">city council website</a></p>
            
            <h3>District Councils</h3>
            <p><em>Examples:
                <a href="https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/">Cambridge City</a>,
                <a href="https://www.eastcambs.gov.uk/">East Cambridgeshire</a>,
                <a href="https://www.fenland.gov.uk/">Fenland</a>,
                <a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/">Huntingdonshire</a>,
                <a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/">South Cambridgeshire</a>
            </em>
            <p>This is often the most local layer of government, unless you have a town or parish council.
            </p>

            <h2>Other layers</h2>

            <h3>Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA)</h3>
            <p>This is a newer layer of government, led by a directly elected Mayor (currently the Conservative Paul Bristow), covering both Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. It sits above all of the other local councils and has representatives from each.</p>
            <table>

                                <li>Major transport projects</li>

            <h3>Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP)</h3>
            <p>In 2014, Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire signed a "city deal" which granted up to Â£500m in funding between 2015 and 2030 (subject to gateway reviews every 4-5 years). The <a href="https://www.greatercambridge.org.uk/">Greater Cambridge Partnership</a> was set up to use this funding to support growth in Cambridge and the surrounding area through infrastructure, housing and skills investment.

            <h3>Town/Parish Councils</h3>
            <p>Some areas, particularly on the edges of Cambridge and in surrounding villages, also have a Town or Parish Council. These are the most local level of government and generally have more limited powers.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://thecgc.org.uk/index.php">Cambridge Growth Company</a> was established by the government in 2024 and its stated aim is to "unlock and accelerate development and deliver the homes, jobs and infrastructure needed for long-term, sustainable growth." It was recently announced that government would be supplying funding of Â£400m to support this objective, although there are not yet hard details on how this will all be put together and work. It may be that it will operate quite similarly to the GCP in practice.

            <h1>Got all that?</h1>
            <p>Don't worry if not, because it's all changing soon. The current government are planning to replace all two-tier councils in England with "unitary" authorities. For Cambridgeshire, that means the current county and district councils will be replaced with a single layer. Cambridgeshire is likely to end up with two of these unitary authorities (Peterborough already has one). Where the boundaries will be or when that will happen is not yet decided, but the government is aiming for the change to be in place by 2027-28.</p>
